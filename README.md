# data-cleaning-study-case

Here is a mini project that I did as a requirement for data engineer candidate in Company "X"

1. First, I was given raw data (data-set.xlsx) about ATM machine rental and its activity history and I was asked to data cleaning, analysis and visualization. 

2. I'm doing the whole processing in Jupyter Notebook (Muhammad Fauzan Al-Baany_DataCleansing.ipynb) and I have explained each step in it. After that, I save the results of data processing to a new file (clean dataset.xlsx)

3. At the Final step, the data that I processed is ready to be visualized (Muhammad_Fauzan_Al-Baany_Data_Engineer_Dashboard.pdf). Link for dashboard: https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/8b33b87c-40ae-49b8-b361-1f5c38198ed6
